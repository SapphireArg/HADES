# HADES
Made for the 2022 Space Apps challenge, by team [HADES](https://2022.spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/2022-challenges/exploring-venus/teams/hades-2/project).

The Project HADES (Human Advanced Device to Explore Space) proposes a solution to the challenge of designing an energy storage system capable of withstanding the adverse conditions present on Venus for 60 days. The solution proposed makes use of a Savonius wind generator mechanically coupled to a transmission for propulsion, taking atmospheric data, signaling and a coil spring, the latter serving as a mechanical energy reserve; while on the other hand there is a primary, rechargeable and high energy density Lithium - Sulfur battery which makes use of in situ resources and provides energy to the Rover's remaining systems.

Our project solves the challenge using data from NASA, JAXA and CONAE, providing the way to explore Venus and thus be able to obtain data that helps to understand it. In the same way, this energy storage system is not limited to this application and it can be used in other fields.
